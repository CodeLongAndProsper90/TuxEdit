Thank you for choosing TuxEditor as your editor.

Why use TuxEdit?

Well, if you need to use a text editor on a light weight system...

But I diverge!

First things first, if you come from the Lands of Microsoft, TuxEdit is a lot like notepad.

You can point-and-click on the menus, and select options.

File:
  The file menu has three operations:
  Save:
    Write the current file to disk
  Open:
    Write the current file to disk, and load a new file into the editor
  New:
    Write the current file to disk, and start over again.
Run:
  This feature is for devs, and you may not need it.
  There are two options:
  Run:
    Run the current file
  Configure:
    Choose the command you use to run the file. Please, keep it on ONE line. Thanks
Help:
  This one is self-explanitory
  About:
    This tells you information about TuxEdit.

TuxEdit does not have Editor MACroS
Real programmers use Vim.
